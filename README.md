### By [Eviatar Bach](http://eviatarbach.com/), presented at AGU Fall Meeting 2019

---

A four hour crash course in Python focusing on reading and visualizing data-sets used in Earth sciences. The material here has been modified from the courses taught earlier by [Rebekah Esmaili](http://www.rebekahesmaili.com), [Kriti Bhargava](https://cisess.umd.edu/meet-our-scientists/kriti-bhargava/), and Eviatar Bach.

This course covers the following:

1. Basics of Jupyter Notebooks and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
2. Reading tabular files using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), basic plotting using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
3. Reading NetCDF files and doing operations on N-dimensional arrays using [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/)
4. Geographical plotting using [Cartopy](https://pypi.org/project/Cartopy/) and regridding using [pyresample](https://pyresample.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
5. Basic use of Git and [Panoply](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/)
